## 📜 Overview
This pipeline is designed to analyze **RNA-Seq data related to LBD (Lewy Body Dementia)**. The workflow consists of:
- **Quality control** using FastQC
- **Adapter trimming** using Trimmomatic
- **Alignment** using STAR
- **Gene expression quantification** using featureCounts
- **Downstream analysis** with R (DESeq2, GO enrichment)

## 🛠 Requirements
### **Software**
Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

| Tool         | Purpose                  | Installation Command |
|-------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| FastQC      | Quality control           | `sudo apt install fastqc` |
| Trimmomatic | Adapter trimming          | `wget https://github.com/usadellab/Trimmomatic` |
| STAR        | Read alignment            | `conda install -c bioconda star` |
| samtools    | BAM processing            | `conda install -c bioconda samtools` |
| featureCounts | Gene counting           | `conda install -c bioconda subread` |
| R + DESeq2  | Differential Expression   | `R -e 'install.packages("DESeq2")'` |

## ⚡ Running the Pipeline

### **Step 1: Download Raw Data**
```bash
cd datasets
bash SRA_2_FAST.sh
📝 What it does: Downloads sequencing data from SraAccList.csv.

Step 2: Quality Control
bash
Copy
Edit
cd datasets/fastq_files
bash run_fastqc.sh
📝 What it does: Runs FastQC and saves results in fastqc_results/.

Step 3: Trim Adapters
bash
Copy
Edit
cd datasets/fastq_files
bash run_trimming.sh
📝 What it does: Removes adapter sequences using Trimmomatic.

Step 4: Index the Genome
bash
Copy
Edit
cd genome_gtf
bash generate_star_index.sh
📝 What it does: Generates a STAR genome index (needed for alignment).

Step 5: Align Reads
bash
Copy
Edit
cd alignment
bash align_samples.sh
📝 What it does: Aligns reads to the GRCh38 reference genome.

Step 6: Count Gene Expression
bash
Copy
Edit
cd datasets/alignment
bash feature_counts.sh
📝 What it does: Runs featureCounts to generate a gene count matrix.

📊 Expected Output
Step	Output File	Description
FastQC	*_fastqc.html	Quality control report
Trimming	*_trimmed.fastq.gz	Cleaned reads
Alignment	*.bam	Mapped reads
featureCounts	gene_counts_matrix.txt	Gene count matrix
💡 Troubleshooting
🔹 Common Issues & Fixes
Error Message	Possible Cause	Solution
Command not found	Missing dependency	Install the required tool (conda install ...)
Permission denied	Script lacks execution rights	Run chmod +x script.sh
Low alignment rate	Poor read quality	Check FastQC results and consider re-trimming
